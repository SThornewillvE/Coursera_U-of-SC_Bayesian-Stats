# Coursera Bayesian Stats. (University of Santa Cruz)

## Description

Thus far, the University of UC's course on bayesian statistics has been the best I have taken on the topic.

The course is in R and so I decided it would be a good opportunity to practice my R skills and make sure that I understand these concepts for the future.

Note that I will not be uploading results for the tests, only what we learn in lessons or my own project, which is the capstone for the course.

## Important files and notes

Files are written in R.
